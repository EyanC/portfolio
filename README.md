The navigation bar is three interactions.
The buttons cancel each other out as the user clicks the buttons. 
The cursor changes when it is hovered over the tool bar. 
There are four links in the footer of the page. 
There is a modal on the Projects page. 




I attempted to add a dark mode, my mind was finished by the time I go to the end of the project. 

I would have like to add another picture on the home page and change the opacity, but I was not able to figure it out without lightening the text. Yes, they were in seperate <divs>. 

Overall I feel that I have learned how to do a lot!
